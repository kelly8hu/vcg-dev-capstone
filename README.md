# VCG Development Capstone

This project is part of a capstone for Valley Consulting Group, where we can create a technical project of our choosing. This producted is called Fuzzle, and it is to help busy college students or parents make healthy, cost-effective, and easy meal options with the ingredients they have on hand. 

We created a **filtering method** that allows the user to input the ingredients they have, and it will output a recipe that utilizes those ingredients. 

In addition, we integrated a **KNN classification** model trained on a large public nutritional dataset where customers can see if the ingredients they use to create a recipe creates something that is healthy, moderately healhty, or unhealthy.
